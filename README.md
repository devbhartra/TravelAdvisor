Execution Procedure:

The commands to create the database are found in the file createstatements.txt in the folder Phase 2.
Data can then be inserted to the database by running the commands containing insert statements found in the insertstatements.txt file, also in the folder Phase 2. Please note that due to the large size of the data being worked with, we have used 'copy' statemnts to import the data which is stored in the csv files, which can be found in the folder - Data.
